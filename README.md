Extreme fractal noise distortions. Sort of looks like coral blooms on the surface of a dark ocean.

I would appreciate it, if you end up using this code in any sort of production situation, that you cite me in your code and let me know what you've used it for. I love seeing that people actually get use out of the things that I write, and I don't think it's too much to ask that I get a citation for my troubles :)
